                    The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the School of Art. It is conferred
                    by
                    the
                    University upon recommendation of the faculty after successful completion of all course work in
                    residence and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by the faculty. It implies
                    distinctive
                    achievement on the part of students in studies in the professional area of their choice and
                    demonstrated
                    capacity for independent work. The minimum residence requirement is two years. All candidates’ work
                    is
                    reviewed by faculty at the end of each term. If the work is not considered satisfactory, the student
                    may
                    not be invited back to complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under Academic
                    Regulations
                    in the chapter General Information). All degree candidates are expected to be present at the
                    Commencement exercises in May unless excused by the dean.

                    Course work for the Master of Fine Arts degree carries a minimum of sixty credits. The disposition
                    of
                    these credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed upon at the time of registration
                    between the student and the student’s faculty adviser.

                    Each department has its own visitors program in which professionals from outside the School are
                    invited
                    to lecture to students or take part in critiques.

                <p>
                    The School also facilitates a public all-school lecture program, in which ideas of general and
                    cross-disciplinary importance are explored by visiting artists and members of the faculty in events
                    typically hosted in the evening that are free and open to the public.

                    The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and EIK at 32 Edgewood Avenue provide a year-round forum
                    for
                    the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments of
                    the
                    School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery is open to the public when exhibitions are
                    scheduled, but open hours vary by semester. EIK is open during limited hours for specific
                    exhibitions
                    and events. Please refer to the Gallery & Publications page for more information.
