                    The School of Art galleries in Green Hall provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work by
                    students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments of the School and the
                    undergraduate program.

                    to COVID-19, it will <b>remain open only to the Yale community until further notice.</b>
